# SwiftUI Networking Exploration

## Overview

This project serves as a foundational exploration of network calls within the SwiftUI framework. It aims to illustrate how to perform basic network operations and handle asynchronous data fetching while maintaining a responsive user interface. Additionally, this project may touch on other core concepts in SwiftUI to provide a more comprehensive understanding of app development in this modern UI toolkit.

## Objectives

- **Understand Network Calls**: Learn how to perform network requests, handle asynchronous data, and update the UI upon data reception.
- **Explore SwiftUI Concepts**: Dive deeper into SwiftUI's components, state management, and navigation.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage and respond to network errors gracefully.
- **Code Readability**: Use `guard` statements for cleaner code and safer unwrapping of optionals.
